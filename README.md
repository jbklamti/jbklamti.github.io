### Jean Belo KLAMTI 
has been a Research officer within NRC since October 2023. He was a postdoc fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo from October 2020 to April 2023. He attended the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar for his university degrees. His Ph.D. research was on the “Design of Post-quantum Cryptosystems and Generalization of the Information Set Decoding Attack”, focusing on the design of error-correcting codes and code-based encryption schemes. It allowed him to participate in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization competition by contributing to the implementation of a code-based candidate named DAGS. 

Before moving to Waterloo, Jean Belo was on the faculty from 2016 to 2020 at Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar. He has experience in teaching and supervising undergraduate and graduate students.

Sept. 2020: Baccalaureate Office, Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar – Senegal

- In 2020, for the organization of the national Baccalaureate examination in Senegal, I was the President of jury 976 (Wack Ngouna, Kaolack). This jury is one of the main juries of this national examination. It was made up of two sub-juries. As part of the jury work, I had to coordinate, delegate tasks, and then make decisions for the smooth running of the tests.
